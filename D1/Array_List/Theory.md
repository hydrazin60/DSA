1.  Built-in Data types
</summary>
 # int, float, list, tuple, dict, set, and range are all built-in data types in Python. Since they are built into the language, they do not require any import to use them.

1> Data Types:
. nt: Integer numbers (e.g., 5, -3, 100).
. float: Floating-point numbers (e.g., 3.14, -2.0, 0.001).
. list: Mutable ordered collection (e.g., [1, 2, 3]).
. tuple: Immutable ordered collection (e.g., (1, 2, 3)).
. dict: Key-value pairs (e.g., {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}).
. set: Unordered collection of unique elements (e.g., {1, 2, 3}).

2> Built-in Function:

range: Generates a sequence of numbers, typically used in loops (e.g., range(5) gives 0, 1, 2, 3, 4).

Arrays are sequence types and behave very much like list, but arrays can have elements of limited type
